# My name is Melanie!
I like making things and doing stuff!

Primarily:
- Rust (backend, firmware)
- Blender (props for vr)
- Unity (C# scripting, shaders, ect)
- JavaScript (where needed)
- KiCad 

## TODO this website is old and i wanna make it staticly rendered
I enjoy researching low level protocols and building browser-native packages!

(website rendered entirely in-browser with preact and htm!)
